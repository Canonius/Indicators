# Indicators

This repository contains the C# source code of all indicators included in NakedMarkets software (www.naked-markets.com).

It can be useful for developers who want to design their own indicators with the NakedMarkets Indicator API (www.naked-markets.com/Wiki/Indicators_API).

Each folder contains the Visual studio SLN project file, the C# source code file (CustomIndicator.cs) and the generated DLL file.

Each custom indicator implements the abstract class IndicatorInterface. This abstract class is defined within the IndicatorInterfaceCSharp.dll file.
